# Linux

Amethyst offers packages for Debian and Arch based Linux distros. Currently the only way to install them is by downloading the packages from the [releases](https://github.com/kinderhead/Amethyst/releases) page. Builds for both x64 and Arm are available.

Linux packages place the standard library (the `std` folder) at `/usr/share/amethyst/std`. Amethyst will fallback to this folder if no `std` folder is detected next to the executable.
