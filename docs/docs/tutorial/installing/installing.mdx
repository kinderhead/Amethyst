# Installing

Builds are created on each commit and on [release](https://github.com/kinderhead/Amethyst/releases). Since Amethyst is in beta, it is recommended to update frequently. To aid this, a couple platforms have installers or packages built for them.

The bleeding-edge nighly builds can be accessed through Github Actions or here:

| OS | Builds |
