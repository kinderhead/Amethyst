# Platform Agnostic

Amethyst does not currently have installers for all platforms. Instead download a bundle from the [releases](https://github.com/kinderhead/Amethyst/releases) page, extract, then add to path.

## Example Folder Structure

Until installers are created, the following folder structure is both simple and easy to update:

* \<root folder of your choice\>
  * amethyst(.exe)
  * std
  * projects
    * \<project folders\>

With this system, the compiler can be invoked from a project's directory with `../../amethyst`. Alternatively the `projects` directory could be omitted and have each project just be a folder under the root. Then `../amethyst` can be used to run the compiler.
