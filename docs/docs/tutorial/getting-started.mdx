# Getting Started

## Setting Up

Not every feature is covered in the tutorial. The handbook is still a valuable resource and you should read it to get the full picture.

### Visual Studio Code

It is recommended to use Visual Studio Code since an [extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=kinderhead.amethyst-language) exists to provide syntax highlighting and more in the future.

:::note
The extension's version does not match up with the compiler's version. An update is only made to the extension when the Amethyst syntax changes. If you encounter incorrect highlighting, try updating the extension.

### Minecraft

This version of Amethyst is tested on Minecraft 1.21.9 through 1.21.11, but can theoretically work in versions as early as 1.20.5 or so.

There are two main ways to run an Amethyst program:
1. Create a Minecraft world and build the data pack into the `datapacks` folder in your world.
2. Use an automatically configured Minecraft server with the built-in [daemon mode](../handbook/daemon.mdx).

To use the second option, run `amethyst setup --eula` to install the Minecraft server. An appropriate version of Java must be installed on the machine for this to work. See the [documentation](../handbook/daemon.mdx) for configuration options.

## Your First Program

Create a file called `tutorial.ame` and copy the following program into it:

<Highlight code={`\
    namespace tutorial;

    #load
    void main() {
        print("Hello World");
        amethyst:exit();
    }
`}/>

Then open a terminal in the same directory as `tutorial.ame` and run the following:

```sh
amethyst build tutorial.ame -o out.zip --run
```

If everything was configured correctly, your console should say `Hello World` after a few seconds. Subsequent runs will be faster since Amethyst keeps the Minecraft server alive for a while.

If you did not set up a Minecraft server, copy or symlink the data pack to the `datapacks` folder of your Minecraft world and then run `/reload`.

Let's break down the program.

<Highlight code={`\
    namespace tutorial;
`}/>

The first line tells the compiler what namespace to put the functions into. In this case, we use the `tutorial` namespace. If you were to omit this line, then everything would be put into the `minecraft` namespace.

See [Namespaces](../handbook/language-features/namespaces.mdx) for more information on namespaces.

<Highlight code={`\
    #load
    void main() {
        
    }
`}/>

The next part is the `main` function. All logic must be placed into a function. In this case, we chose the `tutorial:main` function. A function is not just some abstraction that Amethyst makes, it is just a `.mcfunction` file and can be called like any other data pack function.

There is nothing special about the name `main`. The function could as very well been called anything. The reason it was ran automatically on load is because it had the `#load` tag. Putting a tag before the return type adds the function to a function tag. `#load` and `#tick` are shortcuts for `#minecraft:load` and `#minecraft:tick`, respectively.

<Highlight code={`\
    print("Hello World");
`}/>

The first line of the function prints `Hello World` to the chat since `print` uses `/tellraw @a` under the hood. Variables and other non-string constants can also be passed into `print`. All of its arguments are concatenated together with no spaces.

<Highlight code={`\
    amethyst:exit();
`}/>

The last line has no impact on the effect of the function. Its only purpose is to tell `amethyst run` that the program as terminated. Otherwise the program in the terminal will never stop unless you hit `Ctrl-C`. If you are not using `amethyst run`, then you can omit this line.
