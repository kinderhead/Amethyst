# Intrinsics

Amethyst exposes some special Geode IR instructions as inline functions:

* `builtin:print(args...)`: `/tellraw`s all players. Arguments are concatenated with no separators. See [Console](../language-features/console.mdx).
* `builtin:count_of(constant string id)`: gets the number of functions that have a specified tag. Only accepts constant strings.
* Various types in the `minecraft` namespace have intrinsic methods.

:::note  
All symbols in the `builtin` namespace are considered global and can be accessed without `builtin` anywhere.
