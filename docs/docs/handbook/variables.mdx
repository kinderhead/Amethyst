# Variables

## Syntax

<Highlight code={`\
    int x = 7;
    string y;
`}/>

The variable is set to a default value if there is no initializer. Objects with a constructor must have an initializer.

The `var` keyword can be used to inference the type of the variable using the initializer.

## Scopes

Variable obey the traditional rules of scoping, so variables can be redefined inside of scopes and can be accessed from descendent scopes.



## Casting

Values can attempt to be casted to other types. There are two main types of casting: implicit and explicit. Implicit casting, as the name suggests, is done automatically where applicable. Explicit casting happens when using the cast expression:

<Highlight code={`\
    string str = "Hi";
    int x = (int)str;
`}/>

Explicit casting is mainly used for casting down an inheritance tree. However some types have special explicit casting rules. For instance, casting anything to an int will effectively use `/execute store`. So for most values, it will call `/data get` and store that into a score.
