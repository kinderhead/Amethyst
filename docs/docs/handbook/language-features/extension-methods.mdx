# Extension Methods

## Usage

Methods can be added to any type at any time. When searching for a method to call, Amethyst will see if any functions exist that satisfy the following conditions:

* The first argument is a reference to the target type or to a base class of the target type.
* The function is in the same namespace and path as the type, including the name of the type.

For example, this adds an extension method to all objects:

<Highlight code={`\
    void foo() {
        int x = 8;
        string y = "yay";

        x.say();
        y.say();
    }

    namespace minecraft:nbt;

    void say(nbt& this) {
        // print dereferences pointers automatically
        print(this);
    }
`}/>
