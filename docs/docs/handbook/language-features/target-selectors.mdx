# Target Selectors

Minecraft target selectors can be created and used using the `minecraft:target` type. `minecraft:target` is stored internally as strings and can be used in macro scenerios. Currently target selectors are WIP and are missing key features. More uses for them will be added over time.

Target selectors can be implicitly created using the same syntax as they do in commands:

<Highlight code={`\
    var target = @e[x=8,dx=9,name="Steve"];
`}/>

But they can also have dynamic values like so:

<Highlight code={`\
    int my_number = 7;
    var target = @e[x=my_number];
`}/>

:::warning
String arguments like `name` and `type` must be quoted strings or else Amethyst will look for a variable with that name. This may change in the future.
:::

:::note
Many of the arguments have not been implemented.

## Existence Checks

Target selectors can be put in `if` [Execute Statement](./control-flow.mdx#execute-statements) clauses which effectively use `execute if entity` to determine if the entity exists:

<Highlight code={`\
    if (@s[type="minecraft:player"]) {
        @/say I am a player!
    }
`}/>

:::tip
Target selectors can also be converted to boolean values. The result is `true` if `execute if entity` is successful.
