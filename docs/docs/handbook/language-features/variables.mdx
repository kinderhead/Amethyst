# Variables

## Syntax

<Highlight code={`\
    int x = 7;
    string y;
    var str = "foo";
`}/>

The variable is set to a default value if there is no initializer. Objects with a constructor must have an initializer.

The `var` keyword can be used to inference the type of the variable using the initializer.

## Scopes

Variable obey the traditional rules of scoping, so variables can be redefined inside of scopes and can be accessed from descendent scopes.

<Highlight code={`\
    int x = 7;
    int y = 3;

    {
        // Valid, x is now a long in this scope
        long x = 2;
        print(y);
    }
`}/>

## Casting

Values can attempt to be casted to other types. There are two main types of casting: implicit and explicit. Implicit casting, as the name suggests, is done automatically where applicable. Explicit casting happens when using the cast expression:

<Highlight code={`\
    string str = "Hi";
    int x = (int)str;
`}/>

:::info
Explicit casting is mainly used for casting down an inheritance tree. However some types have special explicit casting rules. For instance, casting anything to an int will effectively use `/execute store`. So for most values, it will call `/data get` and store that into a score.
:::

## Math

All the normal operators work as expected (except `%` for now).

Amethyst also provides the following unary operators:

* `++x`
* `--x`
* `!x`
* `-x`

:::note
Postfix increment and decrement (`x++`) does not exist due to clarity concerns. This may change in the future.
:::

:::warning
Minecraft may handle integer division slightly differently than the languages you are used to.
:::

## Strings

Strings in Amethyst are implemented using NBT strings. Only double quotes are supported for now.

<Highlight code={`\
    string str = "Hello World";
`}/>

:::tip
All Minecraft string escape codes can be used.
:::

### Methods

* `.length()`: String length. Compiles internally as `(int)str`.

## Lists

Lists store an ordered collection of values. Untyped lists (using `list`) are unsupported currently.

<Highlight code={`\
    int[] list = [-7];

    list.add(10);
    list.add(5);
    list.add(x * y);

    print(list[2]);
`}/>

### Methods

* `.add(T val)`: Add a value to the end of the list.
* `.size()`: Get the size of the list.

:::warning
There are currently no bounds checks. Eventually it will be included in debug builds and optionally in release mode builds.

## Objects

Typeless NBT compounds can be created using the `nbt` type:

<Highlight code={`\
    nbt x = { thing1: 7, thing2: 6s };
    x.property = "Hi";
    print(x);
`}/>
