# Target Selectors

## Usage

Minecraft target selectors can be created and used using the `minecraft:target` type. `minecraft:target` is stored internally as strings and can be used in macro scenerios. Currently target selectors are WIP and are missing key features. More uses for them will be added over time.

Target selectors can be implicitly created using the same syntax as they do in commands:

<Highlight code={`\
    var target = @e[x=8,dx=9,name="Steve"];
`}/>

But they can also have dynamic values like so:

<Highlight code={`\
    int my_number = 7;
    var target = @e[x=my_number];
`}/>

:::warning
String arguments like `name` and `type` must be quoted strings or else Amethyst will look for a variable with that name. This may change in the future.
:::

:::note
Many of the arguments have not been implemented.

### Negation

Arguments can be negated by putting a `!` after the equal sign. Additionally, multiple arguments of the same name can exist.

<Highlight code={`\
    // The ! can go inside or outside of quotes
    var target = @e[type=!"player",type="!item"];
`}/>

The above is equivalent to:

<Highlight code={`\
    var foo = "player";
    var bar = "!item";
    var target = @e[type=!foo,type=bar];
`}/>

:::warning
No checks have been implemented yet for invalid combinations of arguments. Check the Minecraft logs for errors generated on `/reload`. Adding `-c` to your build command dumps the compiled `.mcfunctions` to the console for easy viewing.
:::

## Existence Checks

Target selectors can be put in `if` [Execute Statement](./control-flow.mdx#execute-statements) clauses which effectively use `execute if entity` to determine if the entity exists:

<Highlight code={`\
    if (@s[type="minecraft:player"]) {
        @/say I am a player!
    }
`}/>

:::tip
Target selectors can also be converted to boolean values. The result is `true` if `execute if entity` is successful.
